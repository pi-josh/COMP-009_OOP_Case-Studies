/**
 * The Ohms program calculate the resistance of a resistor based on the colors of its three bands.
 * Users will be prompted to input the colors of these bands,
 * and the program will map these colors to their corresponding resistance values.
 * Additionally, the program includes a search helper function
 * that allows users to find a target string within a given list of strings.
 * The program aims to provide a straightforward way to determine resistance and assist with string searches.
