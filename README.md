# Case Study Directory

This repository contains the following case studies:

<details>
<summary>Case Study 1: Individual or By GROUP (of FOUR)</summary>

### Intravenous Rate Assistant
Design and implement a program that assists with the calculation of intravenous rates. The program should interact with the user to ensure accurate calculations for hospital supply requirements.

### Non-vertical Straight Lines
Create a program to convert two-point form or point-slope form of non-vertical straight lines into slope-intercept form. The program will interact with the user to facilitate the conversion process.

### ΩMG (Resistor Color Code Calculator)
Design a program to decode the resistance values of resistors from their colored bands. The program will convert these color codes into resistance values expressed in ohms (Ω) or kilo-ohms (kΩ).

<summary>Case Study 4: Graphical User Interfaces</summary>

### Task 1 – Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game application using Java's GUI components. The game features a 3x3 board where two players take turns marking X or O in the squares. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

### Task 2 – Word Counter
Create a Java application using Swing that counts the number of words, characters, and paragraphs in a given text input. This tool is useful for tasks such as writing essays with specific word limits.
